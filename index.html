                <h1>Hello, I'm Jesse. I'm a photographer, husband, father, & friend.</h1>
                <p>For as long as I can remember, people have told me I look familiar. More often than not, this sparks conversations where strangers unexpectedly share stories and things they never intended to reveal; sometimes even thoughts they've never spoken aloud. I used to wonder why this happened so often, but I've come to realize it's not really about me. It's about something deeper: the longing to be known, understood, and truly seen.</p>

            <p>Village Portrait isn't about performance or perfection, but a chance to be photographed honestly & authentically. Social media pressures us to polish & curate, to present only the most agreeable version of ourselves. But there is something far more beautiful in authenticity.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <p>When you place these portraits side by side, patterns emerge. Common threads appear. They remind us that we are all more connected than we might think. A good portrait does not flatter, it reveals. It captures something deeper than appearance; something real.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <p>Reminding myself to be present, open, and embrace what I real has shaped my view of the world. The more I slow down and listen, the more everything makes sense. I want to meet as many people as I can, learn from their experiences, and share the wisdom found in their stories.</p>
